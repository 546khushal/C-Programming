# Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of programming solutions, organized topic-wise for structured practice. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of core programming concepts.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

The repository includes solutions for the following topics:
-**Basic Programs**
Programs demonstrating the use of variables, data types, and constants. Includes calculations like area, volume, distance, and other formulas.

-**Conditional Statements**
Examples using if, if-else, and switch statements, such as leap year checks, prime number validation, and menu-driven programs.

-**Loops and Patterns**
Comprehensive practice with loops (for, while, do-while) and nested loops. Includes pattern printing like pyramids, diamonds, and number sequences.

-**Arrays**
Operations including insertion, deletion, sorting, and searching. Covers single and multi-dimensional arrays with programs like matrix addition and multiplication.

-**Pointers**
Basic pointer usage and arithmetic. Includes pointer-based programs for arrays, functions, strings, and dynamic memory allocation.

-**Strings**
String manipulation programs for operations like reversing, concatenation, and pattern matching. Covers advanced topics like substring search and formatting.

-**Recursion**
Solutions using recursion for problems like factorial, Fibonacci series and string reversal.

-**Dynamic Programming**
Optimization problems using DP techniques, such as the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and coin change problem.
Sorting & Searching
Classic algorithms like Insertion sort, selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and, linear search, Binary Search.
